•toggle the view of the terrain in the circular order:  its points, its wireframe, and its faces.  The key V is mapped to the toggling of the view.

# Some Flight Dynamics

The orientation of a plane in flight is determined by its rotation about three axes.  The rotations, termedpitch,roll, andyaw, and the corresponding axes are illustrated in Figure 2.  Implement mechanisms todynamically effect the following.•each of the indicated rotations constrained to (−90◦,90◦).  Use the following key map.
–W, S(and lower case) for pitch
–A, D(and lower case) for yaw
–Q, E(and lower case) for rollConstrain the rotations to (−90◦,90◦) and the plane’s altitude as appropriate, e.g.  (2.5,3.5).

•increase and decrease the speed of the plane between [0, S] whereSis a maximum speed of yourchoosing.  Use theupanddownarrows to vary speed.
